Thank you for considering my interest in the Regulatory Scientist position (EN58380727_ONLE_2) at the BASF research facility in Limburgerhof, DE - Germany. My educational background and research, extension, and teaching experiences in agriculture have prepared me for a successful career as an Regulatory Scientist. Moreover, the job description aligns with my current and future research interests.
	
My early passion for Agriculture led me to join the Federal University of Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys (UFVJM), in Brazil, for a Bachelor’s Degree program in Agronomy. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with forage and weed reseach. I had the chance to present scientific results at conference meetings. Moreover, I had the opportunity to organize field days, expeditions, and seminars for students and growers. During my senior year, I had the great opportunity to go to the United States through the Ohio State University as a visiting intern student. As part of my senior internship, I worked on a trainee program in a vegetable farm in Michigan, and a hydroponic tomato greenhouse in New York. During the time in Michigan I work extensively with pest control, including weed management, and realized that cropping-systems/weed science was the career path I wanted to follow in my professional life. Back to Brazil, I was offered an assistantship at the UFVJM to start an MS program in Weed Science after my graduation. After my MS program I was hired to work with specialized fertilizer sales in the Amazonian region of Brazil. My role was sales management trainee in the French company TIMAC Agro. I was being prepared to manage a team of fertilizer sales. I worked closely with the company marketing, regional manager, and palm oil/corn/soybean growers. During that time, I quickly realized that research rather than sales, was the path that I wanted to follow in my career. 

In 2013, I applied for a grant through the Brazilian Science Without Borders Program ($130,000) to support my Ph.D. at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), which allowed me to start my program in 2014. As a doctoral student, I worked with Dr. Stevan Knezevic on an *Amaranthus tuberculatus* population that had evolved resistance to 4-hydroxyphenylpiruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)-inhibitor herbicide in Nebraska. In my PhD projects, I work closely with Dr. Todd Gaines and Dr. Franck Dayan from Colorado State University. I had the chance to visit Colorado State University twice during my program to conduct some of my lab work. During my time in Nebraska, I have dedicated part of my time to work on statistical data analysis. I was responsible for analyzing not only my own data, but the research data from Knezevic’s weed science program. I started using R and R-studio in 2014, and now I feel proficient using the software for data analysis. I was able to help my fellow graduate student colleagues on their data analysis, including students from plant pathology and entomology. My programming skill with R lead me to developed my own academic blog (https://maxweeds.rbind.io/) and a collaborative Open Weed Science (https://www.openweedsci.org) project using R-studio, Hugo and GitHub. My blog and Open Weed Science serve as a tool for sharing R codes for data analysis and data visualization commonly used in weed and agricultural research. I believe that handling and understanding data is important to comprehend the big picture, which allows to guide the future needs in agriculture. Also, data analysis and data visualization are crucial for communicating research results to the public. 

In January 2018, I joined Rodrigo Werle’s lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as a Research Associate in Weed Science. I went to Wisconsin to gain more experience in research and extension. I have been working with the objective to assist the Werle’s lab to conduct innovative and collaborative research and extension programming to increase profitability, productivity and sustainability of corn, soybean, and small grains in Wisconsin. As part of my role, I am mentoring graduate students and training the Wisconsin Weeds Team, which went to the North Central Weed Science (NCWSS) Weed Contest in July 2018. The Wisconsin Weeds Team took second place in the 2018 NCWSS Weed Contest in Nebraska. Also, I am writing grants, which will allow me to recruit and train new graduate students in our program. I am currently working part-time to Werle's lab from Brazil, whereas I am appointed as Assistant Professor of Weed Science at Universidade do Oeste Paulista. I am back to Brazil as part of my PhD scholarship agreement.

I’m excited to join the BASF team to implement regulatory science strategies to agricultural communities. BASF strongly contribute to enhance quality of life wordwide. I would be ready to cooperate with the diverse and talented group of scientists located at BASF around the globe. I am confident this position will help me achieve my professional goals and believe that my previous experiences and future goals are a strong fit for the position. My philosophy will be the multidisciplinary work to address the current and future issues in agriculture. Thank you for your consideration and I hope to further discuss this opportunity with you in the near future.


Sincerely,
