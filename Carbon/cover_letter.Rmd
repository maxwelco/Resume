As a weed scientist dedicated to sustainable weed management, I’m eager to apply my expertise in weed ecology, field research, business and data analysis to optimize Carbon Robotics’ LaserWeeder™. While my background isn’t in laser technology, my deep understanding of weed management, resistance mechanisms, and field trial design can help refine your system’s accuracy and adoption.

**How I Can Contribute:**

*Weed Behavior Insights:* My deep knowledge on weed management identifies growth stages and environmental triggers where laser weeding could be most effective.

*Field Trial Leadership:* Research and development; my expertise in data collection, statistical analysis, and translating results to stakeholders aligns with your need for evidence-based product improvements.

*Precision Ag Integration:* At BASF, I leaded the research on precision weed management: smart spray weed control strategies—a skill applicable to enhancing LaserWeeder’s AI targeting.

I’m confident my blend of weed science rigor and collaborative problem-solving can help Carbon Robotics bridge the gap between agronomy and tech. I’d welcome the chance to discuss how my work could support your mission.

Best regards,
