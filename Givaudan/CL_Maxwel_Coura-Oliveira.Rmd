I am excited to apply for the Regenerative Agriculture Manager role at Givaudan. With a decade of experience in agronomy, digital farming, and sustainable crop management, I am eager to leverage my expertise to advance Givaudan’s regenerative agriculture initiatives. While my background includes conventional agricultural systems, my career has been increasingly focused on bridging the gap between productivity and sustainability—driven by a strong commitment to transitioning toward regenerative practices.

My early work in herbicide resistance management, including my PhD research on *Amaranthus tuberculatus*, and my involvement in precision agriculture provided a deep understanding of conventional systems—but also revealed their limitations. This firsthand experience fuels my passion for regenerative solutions that enhance soil health, biodiversity, and long-term resilience. At BASF Digital Farming, I helped develop tools like One Smart Spray to reduce chemical inputs, aligning with regenerative principles. I also coordinated the Expert Scouting Trip project, which emphasized data-driven, sustainable decision-making.

My work has consistently involved multi-stakeholder leadership. At TeeJet Technologies, I trained farmers and applicators on responsible herbicide use, promoting practices that minimize off-target impacts—critical in transitioning to low-input systems. My nationwide weed management survey in Brazil, published in Weed Technology, engaged over 500 stakeholders, illustrating my ability to identify systemic barriers and drive adoption of sustainable practices.

At BASF, I defined key performance indicators for precision farming tools, using R and Python to quantify both environmental and agronomic outcomes. This analytical skill set is directly applicable to measuring regenerative agriculture progress, including soil carbon, biodiversity, and input reduction. I’ve authored over 20 peer-reviewed publications on topics such as herbicide alternatives and cover crop integration, bridging scientific research with practical implementation.

Givaudan’s mission to "celebrate the beauty of human experience" through sustainable innovation deeply resonates with me. I am particularly eager to translate my agronomic expertise into scalable regenerative strategies for your natural ingredient supply chains. I look forward to collaborating with farmers and suppliers to pilot practices like reduced tillage, diversified crop rotations, and bio-based inputs—drawing on my extension experience across North America, Europe, and South America. I am also keen to leverage data and partnerships to align regenerative agriculture projects with corporate sustainability goals, including Scope 3 emissions reductions.

While my career began in conventional systems, it has always been guided by a vision for agriculture that prioritizes planetary health. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background—combined with my commitment to this transition—can support Givaudan’s leadership in regenerative agriculture.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.
