I am pleased to strongly recommend Joaquin Enrria, a graduate student at Kansas State University, for the 2025 WSSA Travel Enrichment Experience Award. I had the opportunity to work closely with Joaquin during the summer of 2024 on spot spray application research in Kansas, where he played a key role in designing and managing field trials under the guidance of Dr. Anita Dille.

Joaquin demonstrated exceptional technical skills, attention to detail, and a deep understanding of precision weed management. His ability to troubleshoot field challenges and collect high-quality data was critical to the projectâ€™s success. Beyond his technical contributions, Joaquin is a collaborative and motivated researcher who actively engages with peers and stakeholders, making him a valuable asset to the weed science community.

This award would provide Joaquin with a unique opportunity to expand his knowledge, network with experts, and bring innovative ideas back to his program. His dedication, work ethic, and passion for advancing sustainable weed control make him an outstanding candidate. I have no doubt he will represent WSSA with excellence.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you for your consideration
