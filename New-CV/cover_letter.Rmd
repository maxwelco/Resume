I am excited to apply for the Toxicology Specialist position at Rovensa. With a Ph.D. in Agronomy and extensive experience in herbicide development, dose-response analysis, and sustainable crop care solutions, I am eager to contribute to your mission of advancing innovative and responsible agricultural practices.

While working in the U.S., I collaborated with the chemical industry on the development and launch of new herbicides, leading field trials and providing data-driven support for regulatory submissions. My expertise in dose-response analysis has been integral to evaluating herbicide efficacy and safety, ensuring products meet both performance and compliance standards.

In my current role as Senior Digital Agronomist at BASF Digital Farming, I lead research on smart spraying technology, integrating precision agriculture solutions to optimize pesticide application. My academic career further solidified my foundation in field research, where I investigated herbicide resistance and contributed to EPA product registration decisions. These experiences have equipped me with a strong understanding of herbicide performance and environmental safety.

As a multilingual professional fluent in Portuguese and English, I am adept at collaborating with diverse teams and stakeholders across global markets. Rovensaâ€™s commitment to sustainable agriculture aligns closely with my professional values, and I am confident my skills in herbicide development, data analysis, and field research would bring value to your team.

I have attached my CV for your review and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application further. Thank you for considering my candidacy.
